## About

This directory should be used to abstract away data structures for use when
prototyping. Often you may be asked to extract data from pages and components to
promote reuse, simplify code, centralize management, etc. Most often this
content will be in `json` format.

You may also be asked to locate data in this folder that has been added from
other sources. This may be in a variety of formats, but commonly `json`, `csv`,
`md`, `txt`.
